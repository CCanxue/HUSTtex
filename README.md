# fzHUST
A series of LaTeX templates for the tasks included in the undergraduate thesis at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. I hope this repository will help you finish your job more effectively and elegantly.

Sincerely, the TexStudio is recommended by Zhou and be sure to set the compiler as XeLaTex. 

Please feel free to contact Zhou Feng at fengzhou1113@gmail.com if you have any question or suggestion. 

Thank you for your help!
